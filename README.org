* General
Here you could find my setup for emacs.

I hope you'd find it useful.
* Important remarks:
** My .emacs file
In practice my =.emacs= file looks like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d")

(load "main_setup")

;; Enable a backtrace when problems occur
;; (setq debug-on-error t)
#+END_SRC

and all the files which you can find in this repository are located in
~/.emacs.d. In particular =main_setup.el=!
